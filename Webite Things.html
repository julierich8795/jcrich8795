      <p> <font color= "Grey"> Austin, in the green, is almost 27 and is a software engineer. Austin is a fan of the braves, bulldogs, falcons, and hawks. An all encompassing Georgia fan. Carter, in the black, is almost 23 and is an inspector for paper mills. Carter is not a sports fan. Instead, he likes to work on cars, go off-roading, watch spongebob, and eat potato chips.If you notice, Carter is indeed holding a rock. We are very close for siblings and have grown closer the older that we have gotten.

      <h3> My Mommy </h3>
      <p> 
        <font color= "blue"> My mom is the bomb.com. She is my best friend and is the kindest person I have ever met. My mom and I have so much fun together even doing the tiniest of things. My mom tells me all the time I am her all over again. The older I get the more I realize this, but I am A-okay with it. I admire my mom for her strength, and I am forever thankful and grateful I get to call her my mom.

      <p> I was raised on classic rock growing up, so you could say my mom raised me right. Here is my favorite song: <u> China Grove:</u>
